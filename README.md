## Introduction

Persona Grata is a User Persona generator built for the niche audience of a Turing Student running low on creativity. This project was assigned as a final solo project of Module 3 at [Turing School](turing.edu) and was completed within 5 days. This project was a showcase of lessons throughout the module - including React fundamentals, React Router, React Hooks and Cypress testing.

When visiting the application, a user immediately views a randomly generated User Persona. The information includes an image, stats and the user's favorite quote. This information should allow a user to help create a User Persona in order to inspire creativity for app ideas. There are also suggested questions to ask about a user's persona to aid in brainstorming. A user is able to save a User Persona to favorites to come back to at a later point. The app user is able to navigate to a different page to view their saved User Personas, and then is able to come back to the home page to continue searching through users.

## Wins
  - Set an achievable MVP and reached the MVP goal
  - Thorough testing using Cypress
  - Using data down, actions up principles to enact a favoriting feature
  - Close attention to User Experience - reflected in the routing and multiple ways to easily return to the main page

## Challenges & Improvements

  - Troubleshooting async issues
  - Possible future improvements:
    - Create a backend to allow POSTs to the API so that user personas will persist
    - Improve CSS for better user experience
    - Add text input fields with the suggested questions and allow the app user to save input comments with their User Persona
